# Week 3 report
This week went a little bit better. Got started on the actual implementation of DES algorithm and the custom matrix class for the needed matrix operations. Matrix class is almost done, methods to it will be added as needed. Also got some testing done.  
Even though some work had to be scratched and redone as it was not implemented correctly and didn't work. Also added the time complexities of the algorithms to the page. Lot of work still has to be done during next week to meet the week 4 criteria, but that should not as big of a problem anymore.  

Time spent: 18h.

## Week 6 report
Project looks quite bad still. Not even expecting to get any points from this week, which had the same problem as last week. No time, but didn't come this far to quit.  
Algorithms should now be functional, the actual user interface and documentation are still completely missing, and testing as well. 

Time spent: 4h

# Week 2 report
Week 2 was a train-wreck on my part. My time managing was thrown of by some personal issues, so I had almost no time to work on the project untill the last night.
Also the algorithms needed more time than I expected, so almost none work is visible. The only working part at the moment is parity checking which isn't a lot. I will continue to work on the project through the weekend to catch-up. I also tried to write JavaDocs as I write to code so that should be in order for the parts that are implemented / I ahve started working on. Testing is basically non-existant at the moment.  

  Time spent: ~5.5h

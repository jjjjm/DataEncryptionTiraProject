# Project definition
This project will implement some data encryption algorithms and compare the performance of those algorithms (both time and space complexity).
The algorithms that will be implemented are DES (Data Encryption Standard), and RC4 (Rivest Cioher 4), possibly others if allotted time allows it (AES, some public key algorithm such as RSA).    
## Algorithms and Data structures  
  Both algorithms mostly use array operations and byte-level manipulation to achieve the designed output. Both algorithms also have parity check for the keys used.

## Input / Output  
  The input file is any file and output is encrypted version of input file.

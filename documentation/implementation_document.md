# Implementation document
## Program structure
The program will use the classes that implement the Encryption interface to encrypt data given by the FileHandler class from any file. The files and encryption keys will be given to the encyption class by a CLI through the main program. Also DES will use BinaryVector64 and BinaryMatrix64 classes to perform some matrix calculations and help with bit-level operations. RC4 willalso use BinaryVector to help with bit-level operations.
